### 1. Choose Your Audio  
Select the audio file you want to use (e.g., an MP3 of _Never Gonna Give You Up_).

### 2. Create the Hidden Image  
Use Coagula to draw your flag text.
- In Coagula, draw the flag as an image.

### 3. Stabilize the Frequencies
This step is important:
- Make sure the generated audio from Coagula does not overpower or distort the original song.
- Adjust gain and frequency placement so the hidden flag appears clearly in the spectrogram.
- Usually, placing the flag in higher frequencies (where vocals/instruments are less dominant) works best.
-  Export it as audio.
### 4. Merge the Audio Files
- Open both the original song and the generated spectrogram audio in Audacity.
- Split Stereo Tracks.
- Align them properly.

- Reduce the volume of the spectrogram track so it blends naturally.

- Export the final result as an MP3.
### 5. Test the Challenge
- Reopen the final MP3 in Audacity.
- Switch to spectrogram mode.
- Confirm the flag is clearly readable but not obvious in waveform view.
