You are given an MP3 audio file.

Your goal is to find the hidden flag inside the file.

This challenge demonstrates one of the easiest and most common forms of steganography in audio (and sometimes video) files - hiding visual information inside the spectrogram.

The flag is not hidden in metadata or encoded text.  
Instead, it is visually embedded into the audio frequencies and can only be seen when viewing the file in spectrogram mode using tools such as **Audacity**.

Open the provided MP3 file(In Message.rar), analyze it carefully, and reveal the hidden message.
